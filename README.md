# Bible Door

A mobile-first Bible reader app using a key to load files from our server

## History

Bible Door (rebranded from *CustomBible* in 2018) was first [developed](https://freely-given.org/Software/BibleDoor/) in December 2013 as a Java Android app, and then later restarted in Flutter/Dart in 2018, but then delayed by other priorities.

We aim to restart development in the second half of 2022, continuing in Flutter/Dart2 in order to create apps for Android, iOS, and Ubuntu desktop.

## Overview

[Freely-Given.org](https://Freely-Given.org) provides the online [Bible Drop Box](https://Freely-Given.org/Software/BibleDropBox) service whereby one can submit/drop a set of Bible files in one of a range of formats (USFM, USX, OSIS, Paratext archive, ScriptureBurrito, etc.) and the [Bible Organisational System (BibleOrgSys or BOS)](https://GitHub.com/Freely-Given-org/BibleOrgSys) is used to process the Bible and make a number of different converted exports available. One export is a short key code like word-123-456. When typed into this app, this key can open a Bible Door and make your finished or test Bible version available to the community (depending on how widely you share this key).

The Bible Door app will also be customised (hard-coded) with some specific open-licensed Bible versions included and distributed with the renamed app (like Bible Door WEB for the World English Bible), i.e., these larger apps will contain the Bible data in the distributed files, and no key code will need to be entered.

A customised version of the Bible Door app will also be the initial distribution platform for the forthcoming [Open English Translation](https://OpenEnglishTranslation.Bible) of the Bible. One important feature of the OET is the ability to display and scroll both the Readers' Version and the Literal Version together.
